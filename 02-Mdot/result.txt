The extremely short spin periods shown by the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars are the result of long-lasting mass transfer from low mass companion stars through an accretion disc onto a slow-rotating NS as predicted by the so-called "recycling scenario"". At the end of the mass transfer phase, a millisecond pulsar shining from the radio to the gamma-ray band, and powered by the rotation of its magnetic field, is expected to turn on. The close link shared by radio millisecond pulsars and AMXPs has been observationally confirmed by the transitional binary systems IGR J18245 2452 as well as by other transitional millisecond pulsars. Here I will discuss the temporal and spectral properties of the recently discovered AXMPs IGR J17379-3747 and IGR J17591-2342. Moreover, I will present the latest updates on the long-term orbital evolution of the intermittent AMXP SAX J1748.9-2021 obtained combining the updated set of ephemeris from its 2017 outburst with those of the previous outbursts. The orbital period derivative will be then discussed in terms of the possible evolutionary scenarios of the binary system."</span></span></div>

Di Salvo (Dipartimento di Fisica e Chimica, UNIPA), A.F. Gambino (Dipartimento di Fisica e Chimica, UNIPA) Several low mass X-ray binary systems hosting a neutron star (NS-LMXBs) show, generally, two spectral states: the so-called soft state (SS) and hard state (HS). The spectral state of a NS-LMXB source moves from hard to soft (and vice-versa) over the time and the detection and recognition of transitional states is actually a challenging task. Recently, it was observed that some of these sources shows a hysteresis-like pattern in their hardness-intensity diagram (HID) and rms variability-intensity diagram (RID): the systems evolve from HS to SS and come back to the former state following a specific evolution track (Munoz-Darias et al. 2014). Since these sources seem to follow similar track, we can expect to recover the same patterns studying their spectral variability on long temporal baseline. Then, we used the INTEGRAL data collected in the last fifteen years to reproduce the HID for a sample of persistent NS-LMXBs. We extracted the broadband spectrum from several regions of the HID for each source in order to understand cyclical spectral variations (if present) and highlight the different spectral states which each source goes through. We investigated the spectral behaviour and we determined the average properties in HS, SS and in the transitional states (identified as hard-high and soft-low states) for each one. The obtained results encourage us to extend this study to all the persistent NS-LMXBs (about 30 sources) detected by INTEGRAL.</span></span></div>

We show that in all the cases a bulk of the observed OIR emission was determined by extension of the power-law spectral component responsible for the hard X-rays. A contribution of the outer region of an accretion disc, even taking into account X-ray heating of its surface, is very moderate during the high state of the sources (when a soft black-body component dominates in their spectra) and is negligible during their low (hard) state. This result suggests that a notable portion of their OIR emission is formed in the same region where the hard X-rays are produced. It may be Comptonized emission from the hot central region or synchrotron emission from the disc's corona or jets.</span></span></div>

Using data from NuSTAR, INTEGRAL, Swift, Chandra and XMM-Newton several dozen X-ray pulsars were studied in different states that allowed us to discover a propeller effect for several systems and, at the same time, to reveal an unexpected quasi-stable state for other systems associated with the accretion from cold (non-ionised) disc. We argue that a transition to one or another state determines by a combination of the rotation frequency and magnetic field strength. Additionally, a systematic investigation of X-ray pulsars in their quiescent states showed, that all systems can be roughly divided into two distinct groups: i) relatively bright objects (L~10^34 erg/s) and (hard) power-law spectra, and ii) fainter ones showing thermal spectra. The spectral and temporal characteristics of the registered emission and their evolution made it possible to obtain new estimates of the parameters of neutron stars and the properties of matter near them.</span></span></div>

Another method to measure the truncation radius rely on a spectral analysis, particularly on the shape of broadened iron line. Using outbursts of MAXI J1535+571 and GRS 1739-278 we show, that if both of these methods are correct, then unrealistically large mass of black hole is needed.</span></span></div>

The extremely short spin periods shown by the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars are the result of long-lasting mass transfer from low mass companion stars through an accretion disc onto a slow-rotating NS as predicted by the so-called "recycling scenario"". At the end of the mass transfer phase, a millisecond pulsar shining from the radio to the gamma-ray band, and powered by the rotation of its magnetic field, is expected to turn on. The close link shared by radio millisecond pulsars and AMXPs has been observationally confirmed by the transitional binary systems IGR J18245 2452 as well as by other transitional millisecond pulsars. Here I will discuss the temporal and spectral properties of the recently discovered AXMPs IGR J17379-3747 and IGR J17591-2342. Moreover, I will present the latest updates on the long-term orbital evolution of the intermittent AMXP SAX J1748.9-2021 obtained combining the updated set of ephemeris from its 2017 outburst with those of the previous outbursts. The orbital period derivative will be then discussed in terms of the possible evolutionary scenarios of the binary system."</span></span></div>

Mazzola (Dipartimento di Fisica e Chimica, UNIPA), E. Bozzo (Department of Astronomy, UNIGE), R. Iaria (Dipartimento di Fisica e Chimica, UNIPA), C. Ferrigno (Department of Astronomy, UNIGE), T. Di Salvo (Dipartimento di Fisica e Chimica, UNIPA), A.F. Gambino (Dipartimento di Fisica e Chimica, UNIPA) Several low mass X-ray binary systems hosting a neutron star (NS-LMXBs) show, generally, two spectral states: the so-called soft state (SS) and hard state (HS). The spectral state of a NS-LMXB source moves from hard to soft (and vice-versa) over the time and the detection and recognition of transitional states is actually a challenging task. Recently, it was observed that some of these sources shows a hysteresis-like pattern in their hardness-intensity diagram (HID) and rms variability-intensity diagram (RID): the systems evolve from HS to SS and come back to the former state following a specific evolution track (Munoz-Darias et al. 2014). Since these sources seem to follow similar track, we can expect to recover the same patterns studying their spectral variability on long temporal baseline. Then, we used the INTEGRAL data collected in the last fifteen years to reproduce the HID for a sample of persistent NS-LMXBs. We extracted the broadband spectrum from several regions of the HID for each source in order to understand cyclical spectral variations (if present) and highlight the different spectral states which each source goes through. We investigated the spectral behaviour and we determined the average properties in HS, SS and in the transitional states (identified as hard-high and soft-low states) for each one. The obtained results encourage us to extend this study to all the persistent NS-LMXBs (about 30 sources) detected by INTEGRAL.</span></span></div>

We show that in all the cases a bulk of the observed OIR emission was determined by extension of the power-law spectral component responsible for the hard X-rays. A contribution of the outer region of an accretion disc, even taking into account X-ray heating of its surface, is very moderate during the high state of the sources (when a soft black-body component dominates in their spectra) and is negligible during their low (hard) state. This result suggests that a notable portion of their OIR emission is formed in the same region where the hard X-rays are produced. It may be Comptonized emission from the hot central region or synchrotron emission from the disc's corona or jets.</span></span></div>

Using data from NuSTAR, INTEGRAL, Swift, Chandra and XMM-Newton several dozen X-ray pulsars were studied in different states that allowed us to discover a propeller effect for several systems and, at the same time, to reveal an unexpected quasi-stable state for other systems associated with the accretion from cold (non-ionised) disc. We argue that a transition to one or another state determines by a combination of the rotation frequency and magnetic field strength. Additionally, a systematic investigation of X-ray pulsars in their quiescent states showed, that all systems can be roughly divided into two distinct groups: i) relatively bright objects (L~10^34 erg/s) and (hard) power-law spectra, and ii) fainter ones showing thermal spectra. The spectral and temporal characteristics of the registered emission and their evolution made it possible to obtain new estimates of the parameters of neutron stars and the properties of matter near them.</span></span></div>

Another method to measure the truncation radius rely on a spectral analysis, particularly on the shape of broadened iron line. Using outbursts of MAXI J1535+571 and GRS 1739-278 we show, that if both of these methods are correct, then unrealistically large mass of black hole is needed.</span></span></div>

To classify the spectral states of the source we applied a power-law model in order to estimate the 22 -- 100 keV flux and photon index for each spacecraft orbit. Using these results we have prepared four spectral sets, using ISGRI, JEMX and PICsIT spectra, corresponding to four ranges of the hard X-ray flux. These sets were analyzed with a hybrid Comptonization model, allowing to study a variation of several physical parameters of the system when its brightness changes in a broad range. The results are interpreted in a context of the physics of the persistent and transient black hole binaries.</span></span></div>

The instrument ECLAIRs onboard SVOM, a coded-mask soft gamma-ray camera observing in the 4-150 keV energy band with a 2 sr large field of view, will detect the GRBs of the mission. The ECLAIRs onboard Management and Scientific Trigger Unit (UGTS) analyzes the real-time data, in order to detect and localize the GRBs, to request the spacecraft slew for GRB follow-up observations by the other onboard instruments (MXT in X-rays and VT in the visible), and to alert the ground observers.

To classify the spectral states of the source we applied a power-law model in order to estimate the 22 -- 100 keV flux and photon index for each spacecraft orbit. Using these results we have prepared four spectral sets, using ISGRI, JEMX and PICsIT spectra, corresponding to four ranges of the hard X-ray flux. These sets were analyzed with a hybrid Comptonization model, allowing to study a variation of several physical parameters of the system when its brightness changes in a broad range. The results are interpreted in a context of the physics of the persistent and transient black hole binaries.</span></span></div>

SVOM will study GRBs in a wide spectral range thanks to its 4 on-board as well as ground-based instruments. The instrument ECLAIRs onboard SVOM, a coded-mask soft gamma-ray camera observing in the 4-150 keV energy band with a 2 sr large field of view, will detect the GRBs of the mission. The ECLAIRs onboard Management and Scientific Trigger Unit (UGTS) analyzes the real-time data, in order to detect and localize the GRBs, to request the spacecraft slew for GRB follow-up observations by the other onboard instruments (MXT in X-rays and VT in the visible), and to alert the ground observers. This paper presents the ECLAIRs Trigger system.</span></span></div>

Thanks to a relatively high quality of the INTEGRAL/ISGRI spectra, accompanied by spectra collected with several soft X-ray satellites, we analyzed properties of four flux states of the system with physical models including thermal Comptonization. Obtained results, together with various correlations, are discussed in a framework of the common and distinct physics of active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries.</span></span></div>
